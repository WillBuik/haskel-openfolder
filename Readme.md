# Haskell Demo for Visual Studio Open Folder

This repo includes a simple Haskell demo program and the related tasks.vs.json
and launch.vs.json configuration required to build and debug it with Visual
Studio 2017 - this currently requires the latest preview release.

You can also get syntax highlighiting and basic code completion by installing
a Haskell TextMate bundle for VS, such as https://github.com/textmate/haskell.tmbundle.
To install the bundle, create a folder at "%userprofile%\.vs\Extensions" and
extract the contents of the bundle to it. You will need to restart VS. For more
details about adding TextMate bundles to Visual Studio check out https://aka.ms/vs-addtmbundle.
